# Responsive Design Skill

## Context
MarketFlex must look great on all devices, from mobile phones to high-res monitors.

## Guidelines
1. **Mobile-First**: Always start with mobile styles and add enhancements via `@media` queries for larger screens.
2. **Fluid Units**: Use relative units like `rem`, `em`, `vw`, `vh`, and `%` instead of fixed `px`.
3. **Grid & Flexbox**: Use CSS Grid for overall layout and Flexbox for component-level alignment.
4. **Breakpoints**: Use standard, consistent breakpoints across the application.
5. **Touch Targets**: Ensure buttons and links are large enough for touch interaction (min 44x44px).
